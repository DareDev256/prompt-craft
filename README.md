# ⚒ PROMPT CRAFT

**Master the Art of Talking to AI**

An educational browser game that teaches prompt engineering through the COSTAR framework. Write prompts, get scored on 6 dimensions, and see how prompt quality directly affects AI output — all without any API keys.

> Part of the **Passionate Learning** series by DareDev256

## 🎮 How It Works

1. **Choose a category** — Basic Prompts or Context Setting (more coming), or hit **QUICK FORGE** to jump straight in with a random category
2. **Read the goal** — e.g., "Get AI to write a haiku about coding"
3. **Craft your prompt** — Write the best prompt you can
4. **Get scored** — COSTAR engine evaluates 6 dimensions (0-5 each, max 30) with an animated radar chart
5. **See the result** — Pre-written AI response at the quality tier matching your score
6. **Learn the master prompt** — See the ideal version with educational insights

## 🔥 COSTAR Scoring

| Dimension | What It Measures |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **C**ontext | Background and situation setting |
| **O**bjective | Clear task definition |
| **S**tyle | Writing style specification |
| **T**one | Emotional tone direction |
| **A**udience | Target reader identification |
| **R**esponse format | Output structure specification |

## 🏗 Tech Stack

- **Next.js 16** + React 19 + TypeScript (strict)
- **Tailwind CSS v4** — CSS-first `@theme inline`
- **Framer Motion** — Animations and micro-interactions
- **ts-fsrs** — Spaced repetition scheduling (ready for Phase 2)
- **localStorage** — SSR-safe persistence, zero backend
- **Zero API keys** — All AI responses are pre-written
- **Vitest** — Unit tests for scoring engine (19 tests covering tier boundaries, dimension scoring, clamping)
- **Robust state handling** — Fallback loading states prevent blank screens during phase transitions
